Music Generation using Deep Learning

The proposed system generates music using sequence-to-sequence models like RNN, LSTM. It uses MIDI music files as training data. Various preprocessing tasks are performed on the MIDI files before feeding to the model. Finally the music of any length can be generated using the trained  model.
